# Forced-Response Flanker Task (April 2024 Version)

## First Practice

The task consisted of two practice phases and one experimental phase. In the first practice phase, participants trained for 40 trials on a free-response flanker task. On each trial, 5 white arrows appeared on a black ground and participants were asked to indicate the direction of the center arrow while ignoring the direction of the flanking arrows. They were instructed to press the “W” key (for left) or the “P” key (for right). There were two types of trials that appeared equally often: congruent trials (e.g., <<<<<<) and incongruent trials (e.g., <<><<). Each arrow had a size of (.06, .06) with the unit being percentage of screen height. On each trial, two outlined rectangles that had the same width as the row of arrows were also shown on the screen, one above one and one below the arrows. These outlined rectangles served as response signals in later phases of the task. The arrows appeared in between the two outlined rectangles as shown in the figure. The arrows remained on the screen until a response was made. Once a response was made, participants received feedback about their response accuracy. The feedback message was displayed for 400 milliseconds.

## Second Practice

In the second practice phase, participants were given 30 trials of training to learn to produce a response at the time of a “go” signal. In this phase, there were no arrows shown on the screen. Instead, on each trial the two outlined rectangles were incrementally filled with white ink. As a trial began, white ink filled 25% of each rectangle’s inner space every 500 milliseconds, resulting in a fully filled rectangle at 2000 milliseconds. The filling began at the center of each rectangle and expanded to the edges, and the rectangles were filled synchronously. The filled rectangles remained on the screen until a response was made. Participants were instructed to respond exactly when both rectangles were filled with white ink, (i.e., 2000 milliseconds). Participants were told that they could respond with either the W key or the P key, but they were encouraged to practice timing with both keys. After each trial, participants were given feedback for 400 milliseconds about whether they responded too quickly (RT < 1850 milliseconds), too slowly (RT > 2150 milliseconds), or with perfect timing.

## Experimental Phase

The experimental phase was a combination of the two practice phases. Participants performed 10 blocks of 52 trials of the flanker task with forced-response timing and with stimulus presentation time that was uniformly varied prior to the “go” signal. As in the first practice phase, participants were asked to respond to the direction of the center arrow using the “W” and “P” keys. As in the second practice phase, participants were asked to respond exactly when the two rectangles were filled with white ink, (i.e., 2000 milliseconds). The onset time of the arrows was selected from a uniform distribution between 1000 milliseconds and 2000 milliseconds in increments of 20 milliseconds with the value on each trial unpredictable. In other words, the arrows would appear at a random time within one second before the “go” signal. This approach allowed us to measure the accuracy of responses when the exact amount of time allowed for stimulus processing and response preparation was controlled. After each trial, participants received a 400-ms feedback about their timing accuracy, as in the second practice phase. After the feedback, there was an intertrial interval of 600 milliseconds before the next trial began.
